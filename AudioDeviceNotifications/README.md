AudioDeviceNotifications
==============

AudioDeviceNotifications improves on BasicVideoChat sample by adding an advanced audio management system with the following features:
- Integration with default device selection at windows OS level.
- Audio input/output device notifications that are invoked when devices are added/removed or the default selection changes.

Note that removed devices are automatically detected, but added device take a few seconds to be detected by the system.
In the default sample changing the default device at windows OS level also updates device selection in the app without user interaction (this behaviour can be easily changed).

*Important:* To use this application, follow the instructions in the
[Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) section of the main README file for this repository.
