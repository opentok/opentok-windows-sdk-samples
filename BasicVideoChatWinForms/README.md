BasicVideoChat
==============

BasicVideoChatWinForms is a simple application meant to get a new developer started using the
OpenTok Windows SDK with the windows forms presentation framework.
The repo also contains a BasicVideoChat sample that uses WPF and a full description at [Basic tutorial at the OpenTok developer
center](https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/windows/basic-video-chat/).
Althou the presentation framework changes, the basics of the OpenTok framework are the same.

For non WinForms regular users, please note that the code for presentation forms is generally split in two separate files which are hidden by Visual Studio.
One is the code for the designer with placement of the controls in the form.
Another one is the logic. To show this second file, right click on the Forms file and select "show code".

*Important:* To use this application, follow the instructions in the
[Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) section of the main README file for this repository.
